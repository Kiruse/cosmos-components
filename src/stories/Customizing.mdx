# Customizing Cosmos Components
There are various ways to customize these Cosmos Components.

*TODO*

## Design Tokens
Cosmos Components are built with various design tokens as CSS variables
aka. custom properties. These are:

- `--cosmos-bg-panel`: Background color of panels (e.g. tooltips, modals, etc.). Defaults to `rgb(49, 48, 54)`.
- `--cosmos-spacing`: Base spacing unit. Defaults to `8px`.
- `--cosmos-roundness`: Base border radius. Defaults to `4px`.
- `--cosmos-base-font-size`: Base font size. Defaults to `12px`. You may prefer `1em` or another relative unit.

There are a few z-index variables for the various overlays:

- `--cosmos-tooltip-z`: Z-index of the tooltip container. Defaults to `999`.
- `--cosmos-toast-z`: Z-index of the toast container. Defaults to `1000`.

## Customizing Toasts
Toasts can be customized with CSS. On top of the regular design tokens,
it also has a single special custom property:

- `--color`: Highlight color of the toast (e.g. for title & border).

If you need to fully replace the toast with your own, you can do so by
overriding the `toast.show` function. When doing so, be sure to support
the signature:

```tsx
import { type ToastAttributes } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

declare namespace toast {
  declare function show(content: HTMLElement | string, attrs: ToastAttributes): void;
}
```

## Customizing Tooltips
Tooltips can be customized much like Toasts. There are currently non
special custom properties for tooltips.

If you need to fully replace the tooltip with your own, you can do so by
overriding the `tooltip.create` function. When doing so, be sure to support
the signature:

```tsx
import { type CreateTooltipOptions } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

// this type does not actually exist, it is just for documentation
interface TooltipApi {
  destroy(): void;
  update(): void;
  show(): void;
  hide(): void;
}

declare namespace tooltip {
  declare function create(trigger: HTMLElement, content: HTMLElement, options: CreateTooltipOptions): TooltipApi;
}
```

## Customizing Modals
Like everything else, modals can be customized with CSS.

If you find yourself in the need to replace the entire modal with your own,
this is currently not possible. However, in the future, I plan to introduce
the `CosmosComponents` class which will allow you to selectively provide
your own replacements for certain components. Effectively, you will simply
register your own `cosmos-modal-connect` custom element etc.
