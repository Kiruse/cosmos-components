# Tooltip
The `cosmos-tooltip` component implements a rudimentary tooltip built on [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/).
Within this component library, it is used to show full addresses, eg:

<Canvas of={AddressStories.Default} />

It can be manually summoned by calling the `tooltip.create` function:

```tsx
tooltip.create(document.getElementById('my-trigger'), 'This is a tooltip!');
```

To support as many frontend frameworks as possible, the content it accepts is either
a string, or DOM nodes, which makes it rather incompatible with vDOMs like React. You
will likely need to build a helper if you intend to use this component yourself.

Otherwise, I recommend overriding the `cosmos-tooltip` component using the `CosmosComponents`
builder class:

```tsx
import { CosmosComponents } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';
import { MyTooltipComponent } from './my-tooltip-component.js';

CosmosComponents.default()
  .with('cosmos-tooltip', MyTooltipComponent)
  .register();
```

While `MyTooltipComponent` will need to also be a web component, your framework may
have existing tools to expose your own components as web components. For example,
Preact has [preact-custom-element](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-custom-element).
This component library only cares about the default slot.
