# Connect Boundary
The `cosmos-connect-boundary` component is a pure flow control component that
has no other styling or layout responsibilities. It is used to ensure that a
component is only rendered when the user is connected to the network.

<Canvas of={ConnectBoundaryStories.Default} />

It manages 3 distinct states:

1. The user has not yet connected their wallet.
2. The user has connected their wallet, but not signed into your backend yet.
3. The user has both connected their wallet and signed into your backend.

For all 3 states you will need to supply your own content.

If the user has not yet connected their wallet, the component will display
the `connect` slot.

However, as there is no way for these components to know how a user is
supposed to sign in, it is up to you, the developer, to implement the logic
and supply the `is-logged-in` attribute. If the `is-logged-in` attribute is
not supplied, the component assumes that login is not required. If it is
false, it displays the `login` slot. If it is true, it displays the `content`
slot.

The component will emit the `connected` event when the user connects their
wallet. This can be used to automatically prompt the user to sign in.
