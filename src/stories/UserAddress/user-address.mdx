# UserAddress
The `cosmos-user-address` component is a specialization of the `cosmos-address` component which
shows the address of the currently connected user on the currently active network.

<Canvas of={UserAddressStories.Default} />

When not connected, the component will show slottable content. As these components are intended to
be as unbiased as possible, the default content is simply a text label. You may want to substitute
it for a button calling `modals.showWalletModal(...)`.
