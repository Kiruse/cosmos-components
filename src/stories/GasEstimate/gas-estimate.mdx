# Gas Estimate Component
Gas estimation is one of the most common tasks in Web 3. This component makes it easy when using the
[Apophis SDK](https://docs.kiruse.dev/projects/apophis-sdk/introduction). It shows a rounded estimate
of the gas required for a transaction. Upon hovering, it shows a tooltip with the exact gas value.

Unlike EVM, unused gas is not refunded in Cosmos. Not enough gas, and a transaction will fail. Too
much gas, and it will be wasted. Various factors can affect the final gas consumption, including
state transitions since estimation and execution, but also the signature verification, as the estimate
does not include a signature.

Most Web 3 libraries, including Apophis, include a factor to account for this.

Currently, this component only shows a generic error link upon estimation failure which opens an
error modal. You can change the message shown in the error modal by specifying a custom formatter to
`formatError.addFormatters`. In the future, this behavior may be changed and optimized.
