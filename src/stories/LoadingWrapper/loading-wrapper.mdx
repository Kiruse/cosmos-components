# LoadingWrapper
The `cosmos-loading-wrapper` is mainly an internal component shown when
data is loading, e.g. by the `cosmos-modal-wallet` component for its QR
code.

<Canvas of={LoadingWrapperStories.Default} />

It uses the `loading` attribute to determine whether to show the spinner
or its content.
