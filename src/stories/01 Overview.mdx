# Overview
Kiru's Cosmos Components are a collection of web components that I use to build
my Web3 Dapps for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. These components are designed
to be used to jumpstart the creation of new Dapps with as little effort as possible.

However, it is still an early work in progress, and only few components have
been implemented. This page serves as a quick overview of the available components.

## Address
The `cosmos-address` component serves as a standardized way to display Web3
addresses. It shows truncated addresses with customizable truncation length,
shows a tooltip with the full address, and allows copying the address to the
user's clipboard.

<cosmos-address value="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt" bech32prefix="neutron" />

```tsx
<cosmos-address value="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt" bech32prefix="neutron" />
```

## Balance
The `cosmos-balance` component serves as a standardized way to display a
localized & formatted coin amount with denomination.

<cosmos-balance value="1.23456" denom="NTRN" decimals={3} />

```tsx
<cosmos-balance value="1.23456" denom="NTRN" decimals={3} />
```

- `decimals` is the number of decimal places to display, not the number of
  decimals in the coin.

### Account Balance
The `cosmos-account-balance` component is an extension of the `cosmos-balance`
component that fetches the balance of an account from the chain and displays it.
There are some differences compared to its parent component:

- It takes the registered `denom` rather than the display denom. It then looks
  up the display denom and its exponent from the chain.
- It shows a spinner while the balance is loading and no balance has been loaded
  yet, or a stale state if the balance is available and being refreshed.
- Has an error state if the balance cannot be fetched, with a retry button
  and a link to open a modal containing the error details.
- Has a `kind` attribute to specify the kind of coin: native or cw20.

<cosmos-account-balance
  account="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt"
  kind="native"
  denom="untrn"
  decimals={3}
/>

```tsx
<cosmos-account-balance
  account="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt"
  kind="native"
  denom="untrn"
  decimals={3}
/>
```

## Toast

Currently, Cosmos Components use our own Toast implementation. In the future,
we will allow specifying an alternative Toast implementation for consistency
across different systems. Click the button below to spawn a new toast.

<button
  onClick={() => toast.info('This is an informational toast.')}
>Spawn toast</button>

```tsx
<button onClick={() => toast.info('This is an informational toast.')}>Spawn toast</button>
```

These web components are built on the Shadow DOM. Thus, proper integration with
your framework may be non-trivial. Most modern frameworks build on a VDOM, which
is not directly compatible with the Shadow DOM. If you need to provide content
to the Toast that is not just a simple string, you probably want to build a
helper for your framework.

### Error Link Toast
The `toast.errorlink` function is a variation of the `toast.error` method that
includes a link to open a `cosmos-modal-error` containing the error details.

<button
  onClick={() => toast.errorlink(new Error('This is a dummy error'), { message: 'Failed to connect wallet.' })}
>Spawn error link toast</button>

# TypeScript integration
Generally, web components are compatible with JSX by design, as the support only
depends on the browser, not your framework. However, TypeScript is a different
story, as TypeScript is only aware of the standard elements, not custom elements.
Your code will work even if TypeScript complains.

This library ships with TypeScript typings for React & Preact. In the future, it
may be even easier to integrate custom elements as the web standards evolve. But
until then, individual frameworks need to be integrated directly.

To integrate with React or Preact, simply import the typings:

```tsx
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/react';
// or
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/preact';
```

For other frameworks, you may need to define the types yourself. For this, this
library exports the `CosmosElements` interface, which you can use together with
interface merging in an ambient module declaration.

For example, create a `global.d.ts` file in your project root:

```ts
// global.d.ts
import { CosmosElements } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

declare module 'react/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}

declare module 'preact/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}
```

The above snippet is how React & Preact are actually integrated with these
components.
