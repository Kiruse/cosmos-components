# Overview
Kiru's Cosmos Components are a collection of web components that I use to build
my Web3 Dapps for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. These components are designed
to be used to jumpstart the creation of new Dapps with as little effort as possible.

However, it is still an early work in progress, and only few components have
been implemented. This page serves as a quick overview of the available components.

# Setup
These components are designed to be used both with a package manager as well
as a CDN.

## Package Manager
Install with your favorite package manager's equivalent of:

```bash
npm install @kiruse/cosmos-components
```

Then, import in your project:

```ts
import { CosmosComponents } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';
CosmosComponents.register();
```

## CDN
Include the following script in your HTML:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { CosmosComponents } from 'https://esm.sh/@kiruse/cosmos-components';
  CosmosComponents.register();
</script>
```

You may also use an import map to make imports consistent:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  { "imports": { "@kiruse/cosmos-components": "https://esm.sh/@kiruse/cosmos-components" } }
</script>
<script type="module">
  import { CosmosComponents } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';
  CosmosComponents.register();
</script>
```

## Signer Persistence
Often, you will want to preserve which signer the user chose, and automatically
attempt to reconnect to it next time they visit. This library automatically
saves the signer choice in `localStorage`. However, it cannot store your networks,
so you will need to handle reconnecting yourself:

```ts
import { reconnectSigner } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

const networks = [
  // Your networks
];

reconnectSigner(networks); // Promise<boolean>
```

You can await this promise, but you typically don't need to. As the underlying
SDK uses signals, if the reconnection was successful, the signer will be
automatically propagated throughout your Dapp.

Although this library uses `localStorage`, it checks if it is available first,
so calling it during SSR should be safe.

# TypeScript integration
Generally, web components are compatible with JSX by design, as the support only
depends on the browser, not your framework. However, TypeScript is a different
story, as TypeScript is only aware of the standard elements, not custom elements.
Your code will work even if TypeScript complains.

This library ships with TypeScript typings for React & Preact. In the future, it
may be even easier to integrate custom elements as the web standards evolve. But
until then, individual frameworks need to be integrated directly.

To integrate with React or Preact, simply import the typings:

```tsx
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/react';
// or
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/preact';
```

For other frameworks, you may need to define the types yourself. For this, this
library exports the `CosmosElements` interface, which you can use together with
interface merging in an ambient module declaration.

For example, create a `global.d.ts` file in your project root:

```ts
// global.d.ts
import { CosmosElements } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

declare module 'react/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}

declare module 'preact/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}
```

The above snippet is how React & Preact are actually integrated with these
components.

# Caveat about Signals
While you can pass in signals to these components, your framework may unwrap
the signal into a plain value. Preact does this, for example. Generally,
whenever a signal would be updated by these components, they will also call
a callback function, so you can pass signals in directly, but may still have
to rely on callbacks to update your signals.

However, these components currently do not feed data back out to signals.

# About Signers
This library exposes a few `Signer` related persistence functions:

- `rememberSigner(signer: Signer)`: Save this signer as the last used signer
  in `localStorage`.
- `forgetSigner()`: Remove the last used signer from `localStorage`.
- `reconnectSigner(networks: Network[])`: Attempt to reconnect to the last
  used signer, optionally filtered by the given networks.

Further, there are two important signals in the Apophis SDK:

- `signals.signer`: Currently connected signer. This must be set when you
  change the signer yourself. The Wallet Modal will do this automatically.
- `signals.network`: Active network. Although I believe Dapps should be
  built chain-agnostic, a concept of "active network" still applies. it
  is used, for example, to show the user's address. You will always need
  to set this signal yourself.

Other `computed` signals depend on both of these core signals. If something
doesn't work as expected, ensure you have these two signals set correctly.

## Disconnecting Signers
When disconnecting a signer, you should do three things:

```ts
import { signals } from '@apophis-sdk/core';
import { forgetSigner, toast } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

async disconnect() {
  forgetSigner();
  await signals.signer.peek()?.disconnect();
  signals.signer.value = undefined;
  toast.info('Signer disconnected'); // Optional, but recommended
}
```
