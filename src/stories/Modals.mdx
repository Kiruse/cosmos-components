# Cosmos Modals
Cosmos Components come with a small set of pre-built modals to get you started quickly.

## Error Modal
Display a nicely formatted error message to the user. Can be customized with
your own formatters.

<button
  onClick={() => modals.showErrorModal('This is a dummy error')}
>Show Error Modal</button>

## Wallet Modal
Prompt the user to connect their wallet. As these components are built on my
[Apophis SDK](https://github.com/kiruse/apophis-sdk), the modal supports the
same wallets as the SDK.

<button
  onClick={() => modals.showWalletModal()}
>Show Wallet Modal</button>

The `modals.showWalletModal` function returns the modal's custom element
instance. This element, in turn, exposes two events - `connect` and
`cancel` - that you can listen to to respond to the user's input.

Alternatively, as it is built on my Apophis SDK, the `signer` signal will
be populated. Other components of this library also refer to this signal
and will thus automatically propagate updates.

# Customizing Modals
Like everything else, modals can be customized with CSS. You can also replace
individual modals by replacing the respective `modals.show*Modal` function.

Eventually, I plan to introduce a `CosmosComponents` class which will allow
you to selectively provide your own replacements for certain components. Effectively,
you will simply register your own `cosmos-modal-wallet` custom element etc.

## Customizing Errors
The `cosmos-modal-error` component shows formatted error details based on
the argument passed to the `modals.showErrorModal` function. As this component
library is built specifically for the Cosmos Web3 ecosystem, it comes preloaded
with formatters for various common Cosmos SDK errors, such as insufficient
funds, insufficient gas, account not found, etc.

You can add your own formatters by calling the `formatError.addFormatter`
function. Custom formatters are expected to either return a string, an
`HTMLElement`, or `undefined`. The first custom formatter that returns a
non-`undefined` value will be used to display the error.
