# TypeScript integration
Generally, web components are compatible with JSX by design, as the support only
depends on the browser, not your framework. However, TypeScript is a different
story, as TypeScript is only aware of the standard elements, not custom elements.
Your code will work even if TypeScript complains.

This library ships with TypeScript typings for React & Preact. In the future, it
may be even easier to integrate custom elements as the web standards evolve. But
until then, individual frameworks need to be integrated directly.

To integrate with React or Preact, simply import the typings:

```tsx
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/react';
// or
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/preact';
```

For other frameworks, you may need to define the types yourself. For this, this
library exports the `CosmosElements` interface, which you can use together with
interface merging in an ambient module declaration.

For example, create a `global.d.ts` file in your project root:

```ts
// global.d.ts
import { CosmosElements } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components/elements.js';

declare module 'react/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}

declare module 'preact/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}
```

The above snippet is how React & Preact are actually integrated with these
components.
