# Spinner
A rudimentary spinner component to indicate asynchronous operations.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Default} />

Used internally by:

- `cosmos-modal-wallet`, while loading the QR code
- `cosmos-estimate`, while querying the RPC for the gas estimate

Feel free to use it as is, or replace it using the `CosmosComponents` factory. When replacing, make
sure to support the `size` attribute with values `xxs`, and `md`. Other sizes may be used in the
future.

The default spinner has a minimum size of `80px` by `80px` on `md` size, and `16px` by `16px` on
`xxs` size.
