# Overview
Kiru's Cosmos Components are a collection of web components that I use to build
my Web3 Dapps for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. These components are designed
to be used to jumpstart the creation of new Dapps with as little effort as possible.

However, it is still an early work in progress, and only few components have
been implemented. This page serves as a quick overview of the available components.

## Address
The `cosmos-address` component serves as a standardized way to display Web3
addresses. It shows truncated addresses with customizable truncation length,
shows a tooltip with the full address, and allows copying the address to the
user's clipboard.

<cosmos-address value="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt" bech32prefix="neutron" />

```tsx
<cosmos-address value="neutron1r5m978tlcuuuvmaw6xqdj2k2qpv5myxwxpssvt" bech32prefix="neutron" />
```

## Toast

Currently, Cosmos Components use our own Toast implementation. In the future,
we will allow specifying an alternative Toast implementation for consistency
across different systems. Click the button below to spawn a new toast.

<button
  onClick={() => toast.info('This is an informational toast.')}
>Spawn toast</button>

```tsx
<button onClick={() => toast.info('This is an informational toast.')}>Spawn toast</button>
```

These web components are built on the Shadow DOM. Thus, proper integration with
your framework may be non-trivial. Most modern frameworks build on a VDOM, which
is not directly compatible with the Shadow DOM. If you need to provide content
to the Toast that is not just a simple string, you probably want to build a
helper for your framework.
