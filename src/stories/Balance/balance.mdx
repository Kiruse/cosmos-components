# Balance Component
The Balance component is a simple display component that shows a balance value
with a denomination, rounded to a configurable number of decimal places. It has
no other logic. It cannot retrieve balances from the blockchain or a backend.

<Canvas of={BalanceStories.Default} />

The `value` attribute can be a number, a formatted string, or a `Decimal` from
my other package `@kiruse/decimal`.
